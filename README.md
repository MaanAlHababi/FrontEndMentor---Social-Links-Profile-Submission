# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution

This is a solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links

- Solution URL: (https://github.com/MaanAlHababi/FrontEndMentor---Social-Links-Profile-Submission)
- Live Site URL: (https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

1. Compose the skeleton of the page by adding all the elements in order
2. Tidy up the content by aligning the elements, and establish contrast by adding background colors.
3. Style back to front, top to bottom.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

1. How to use the meta tag to properly view the website based on the device's size:
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
